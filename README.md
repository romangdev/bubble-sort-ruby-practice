# bubble-sort-ruby-practice

Practicing basic bubble sort algorithm using Ruby.

Takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the array in 
ascending order. I worked to make the algorithm more effecient
by limiting the number of necessary iterations over the entire 
array through avoiding checking the last n elements that correspond
with the number of iterations passed.
